## Project Proposal (Provisional)

This is the provisional project proposal for the MTA exploratory data analysis project.

## Question / Need:
#### What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 

I plan to analyze the data to explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on MTA ridership. This will include related announcements from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States government.

Through this analysis, MTA can predict the effects of COVID-19 announcements on their ridership per station. It will also help in making decisions related to traffic management and practices like social distancing.

The analysis provisionally will include:
- Finding daily traffic rates in weeks that are related to WHO announcements.
- Finding busiest stations.
- Finding weekdays/weekends traffic differences in relation to working remotely and in-person.
- Finding periods of the day where the highest traffic was recorded.

## Data Description:
#### What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
* The planned dataset is the MTA turnstile data for the period from January to April of 2020. 
* The data will be obtained online from [MTA](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).
