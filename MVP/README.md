## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the MTA Exploratory Data Analysis Project
One of the goals of this project is to find daily traffic rates in weeks that are related to WHO COVID-19 announcements to help in drawing conclusions about the effects of 
WHO announcements on MTA ridership.

Initially, I wanted to analyze the effects of the two back-to-back announcements on February the 2nd where global air travel was restricted and 
February the 3rd where the United States declared public health emergency.

In order to accomplish this, I first found the top 3 stations in terms of traffic during the period from the 25th of January to the 8th of February to compare entries
before and after the announcements.

From the figure above, we can see that the 34 ST-PENN station is the busiest station in that period. 
Therefore, I looked at the daily entries of that station for the specified period.

Now, we can see that there might be a slight decline in daily entries for the dates of February the 2nd and February the 3rd, on the days of the announcements, compared to before,
but overall the entries for the busiest station continued as usual for the rest of the week. Therefore, further analysis is still needed as no definite conclusion can be drawn yet.
