# mta-turnstiles-eda
SDAIA Bootcamp project 1 - exploratory data analysis of MTA turnstiles.

## Background
<b> Recycling helps protect the environment, ensures environmental sustainability and helps to tackle climate change. The New York Department of Sanitation (DSNY) is responsible for collecting trash, cleaning the city of New York and more relevenatly, they're responible for public recycling bins. </b>

<b> Throughout this project, I'll explore 3 datasets to find the ratio of people per bin in each New York borough. By doing so, I'll be able to provide suggestions to further improve the recycling opportunities in New York. </b>

## Database
### The 3 datasets are:
* <b> [MTA Turnstiles](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html):</b> 
<br>This dataset will be used to find the daily traffic in each station which will help get a gauge of how many people pass by each day.

* <b>[MTA Stations](http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/Stations.csv):</b>
<br> This dataset will be used to link the stations to the New York City boroughs.
* <b>[Public Recycling Bins](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Public-Recycling-Bins/sxx4-xhzg):</b> 
<br>This dataset will be used to get the number of recycling bins that are in each New York Borough.

## Final Analysis
#### By the end of this project, and after merging the 3 datasets and doing some data analysis which can be found in detail in the project's notebook [here](https://github.com/MeshalAlamr/nyc-recycling-bins-analysis/blob/main/nyc-recycling-bins-analysis.ipynb), I was able to develop the following table:

#### The table can be better visualized as so:

#### Based on the analysis, I suggest increasing the number of recycling bins in Brooklyn and Manhattan to improve recycling bins usage.

#### A summary of the work and some more visualizations can be found on the project's presentation [here](https://github.com/MeshalAlamr/nyc-recycling-bins-analysis/blob/main/Final%20Presentation.pdf).
